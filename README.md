# Proxy Beans
Define Java Beans as an interface and use it directly. The implementation is based on java dynamic proxies.
Additionally a gson json serializer is provided.

And very old stuff we probably never need again ?!?

## Missing / WIP
* Json deserializer
* Support Java Set
* Change tracking in List and Set
* Create delta-json
